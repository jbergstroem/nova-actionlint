## Version 1.0

Welcome to Actionlint for Nova. This plugin allows you to lint your github actions and get visual feedback
in Nova's issues pane. The first version includes basic support for feedback and a notification to let you
know if actionlint needs to be installed or adjusted to work as intended.
