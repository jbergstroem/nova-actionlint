## Version 1.1.1

Fix a broken image reference in readme.

## Version 1.1

You can now control which paths you want to run Actionlint in. By default, it will only look inside
`.github/workflows` since this is the default place to store github actions. If you store it elsewhere,
add those paths to your workspace preferences.

## Version 1.0

Welcome to Actionlint for Nova. This plugin allows you to lint your github actions and get visual feedback
in Nova's issues pane. The first version includes basic support for feedback and a notification to let you
know if actionlint needs to be installed or adjusted to work as intended.
